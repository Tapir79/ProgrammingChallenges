# Problem 1
Write three functions that compute the sum of the numbers in a given list using a for-loop, a while-loop, and recursion.

# Problem 2
How to find 1 missing number in an int list
* In a list 1 to n, n = highest number on the list
* Get the total count of numbers n * (n+1) / 2
* To get the mising number = Subtract every number on the list from the total sum

# Problem 3
How to remove duplicates in an Integer array

# Problem 4
How to find smalles and largest numbers in an array

# Problem 5
Swap values of 2 variables without a temp variable

# Problem 6
Reverse the order of an Integer 123 -> 321. Find if a number is a palindrome.

# Problem 7
Write a function that combines two lists by alternatingly taking elements. For example: given the two lists [a, b, c] and [1, 2, 3], the function should return [a, 1, b, 2, c, 3].

# Problem 8
Write a function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. As an example, here are the first 10 Fibonnaci numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34.

# Problem 9
Armstrong number

# Problem 10 
Factorial number

# Problem 11
Leap year is divisible by 4
, but when it's divisible by 4 and 100 it's a leap year only when it's also divisible by 400

# Problem 12
Prime numbers. Numbers that are above 1 and divided only by themselves.
2 is the only even prime number because all other even numbers are divisible by 2.
No number is divisible by more than its half.

# Problem 13 
String palindrome

# Problem 
Quicksort algorithm

# Problem
Write a function that given a list of non negative integers, arranges them such that they form the largest possible number. 
For example, given [50, 2, 1, 9], the largest formed number is 95021.
Take any 2 numbers a and b
If ab is bigger than ba then a should come before b.

# Problem
Write a program that outputs all possibilities to put + or - or nothing between the numbers 1, 2, ..., 9 (in this order) such that the result is always 100. For example: 1 + 2 + 34 – 5 + 67 – 8 + 9 = 100.
